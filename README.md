# Nashville Rock-and-Roll Marathon and Half-Marathon Race Results (2016 - 2019)

##Summary

For this project, we received data on both the half and full Rock-and-Roll Marathon (held in Nashville, TN) from the years 2016 to 2019. We were asked questions on these datasets and tasked to use analysis in Microsoft Excel to answer the questions. 

  
##Data Questions 
  
    1. What are the fastest time, slowest time, median, and mean times for each of the 8 races?  
    2. Find the mean and median marathon finish times for all 4 years combined.  
    3. Find the mean and median half-marathon finish times for all 4 years combined.
    4. How many runners each year beat Oprah’s time?  
    5. What percentage of runners in each of the 4 marathons beat Oprah’s time?
    6. What values define the first, second, and third quartiles for each half-marathon?
    7. Is there a year in which runners seem slower or faster? 
    8. What is the difference between Scott Wietecha’s time and the next fastest runner for each year?
    9. Who were the top three marathon runners for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019?

##Analysis

###Data Question 1: What are the fastest time, slowest time, median, and mean times for each of the 8 races?

The fastest, slowest, median, and mean times for each marathon are illustrated by the bar graphs below. These were found by using MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, and AVERAGE functions on each dataset.



3. First time marathoners sometimes set a goal of beating “Oprah’s time,” Oprah Winfrey’s time (04:29:20) in the 1994 Marine Corps Marathon when she was 40 years old.  
          

4. Quartiles help group data into buckets – the first quarter of data is the first quartile, the second quartile (same as the median) is the first half of the data, and the third quartile represents the first 75 percent. Find the values that define the first, second, and third quartiles for each half-marathon. 

5. Is there a year in which runners seem slower or faster? Formulate a hypothesis for any apparent differences.

6. Scott Wietecha has won the Rock and Roll Marathon for 7 years in a row. Compute and display the difference between Wietecha’s time and the next fastest runner for each year.

#### BONUS: Find the top three marathon runners for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Remove any duplicates across years (i.e., Scott Wietecha should only be in the list once). How many unique runners finished at one of the top 3 spots in the past 4 races? In how many of the 4 years did each top 3 runner finish? How has each runner’s time changed from year to year?

##### Create a brief (5 minute) presentation to communicate your findings from this exercise.
